### Overview
A very basic opengl orrery which includes each major planet and the moon in orbit aroud earth



### Todo
The entire code base could use a rework for readability and modularity. It was completed in a time crunch.

List of work that could be done
* Fix the rendering of spheres to use index rendering to boost performance
* Fix Saturn's rings to have a gap and better texturing
* Include cloud movement on planets
* Include major plant moons
* Add night texture with lights for earth
